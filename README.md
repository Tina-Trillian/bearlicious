## Description

**bearlicious** is a place for Berlin foodies to share restaurant recommendations. The restaurants only get added, when a
User is recommending the place. The app gets information about the restaurant (address, geoLocation, picture, name) from the
yelp api with help from the npm package yelp fusion. The restaurant is then displayed on the inbedded google maps map on the 
home page. Which is public and visible to all visitors. When a visitor wants to add a recommendation, or save a bookmark
they need to sign up.
